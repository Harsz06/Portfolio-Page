# Portfolio-Page
Portfolio Page Project
I developed a Portfolio Page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects, skills, and achievements in web development. This project features:

A clean and responsive design for seamless user experience across devices.
Interactive elements powered by JavaScript to enhance functionality.
Well-structured sections for showcasing work, skills, and contact information.
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of front-end technologies, focusing on creating interactive and visually appealing designs. By working on this portfolio, I improved my skills in layout design, styling, and scripting, while also exploring new concepts in web development.

As I progress in my coding journey, I’m committed to learning more technologies, building diverse projects, and continuously enhancing my capabilities to become a proficient web developer.Portfolio Page Project
